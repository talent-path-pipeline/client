## How to be a DM

---

### Course 1: The Adventure Begins! Getting Started with D&D

**Description**: So... what is Dungeons & Dragons, anyway? What do all these acronyms mean? Why do I have all these dice?! Learn the answers to the most basic questions here in this course.

- Lesson 1: An Example Session
  - There's no better way to understand D&D than to see a session in action! Watch a D&D group in action as a DM leads their party through a basic roleplaying session.
- Lesson 2: Sourcing Your Books
  - Wizards of the Coast, the publishers of D&D, have a number of resources--some free online, others available for purchase as print boosk--that you can use to help craft a campaign. Learn here a brief summary of each one so you can decide which you need for your game.
- Lesson 3: Sourcing Your Equipment
  - So you have your books, but what else do you need? There are DM screens, dice, play mats, dice towers, dice trays, miniatures, map tiles, spell cards, and more, but what are all of these things and which do you actually need?
- Lesson 4: Choices, Choices...
  - If you've decided that DMing is for you, you'll have to decide what kind of campaign to run before you get started. Homebrew or storebought? Battle grid or Theater of the Mind? Character-focused or combat-heavy? There's more than one way to roll the dice, and this video will walk you through the different options so you know what's best for you.
- Lesson 5: Finding Your Party
  - So you know what story you'd like to tell... now it's time to find the characters! This lesson walks through different places you can find potential players, and how to choose who will join your table.

### Course 2: Countdown to Session 0

**Description**: Session 0 is the most important session a D&D group will ever have--it's a gathering before gameplay starts, where everyone gets aligned on their characters, their expectations, and their house rules. Prep for it with these lessons!

- Lesson 1: You Make the Rules!
  - The published D&D sourcebooks have their fair share of suggested rules... but as the DM, you have the special privilege to bend those to your will! Learn in this video how to set house rules for your campaign and your world, and begin collecting these guidelines in a Player's Guide for your party.
- Lesson 2: Setting Expectations
  - If your players are expecting a lighthearted comedy romp through the meadows, but you planned a dark, sober story of political intrigue... Nobody is going to have a good time. This video talks about aligning with your players on what your campaign will be... and coming to a compromise when you don't already agree.
- Lesson 3: Dungeon Etiquette
  - D&D is all about having fun, and the best way to make sure that happens is to treat everyone around the table with respect. In this lesson, learn best practices to maintain harmony with your party members--both in and outside the game!
- Lesson 4: Character Creation
  - At this point, your players should be building their characters--and you should be helping! All the data on those character sheets can be daunting, but with this video, you can get comfortable with what it all means.

- Lesson 2: The Actor In You
  - You don't need to be Mel Blanc or Matt Mercer to play many different characters at once! Practice your improv chops and learn how to craft compelling and differentiated NPCs for your party to love... or hate. 
- Lesson 3: Lions and Tigers and Owlbears, Oh My!
  - The D&D world is filled with fascinating creatures--they can be your players' enemies, allies, or even pets! Watch this video for some suggestions of creatures to incorporate into your story to scare and delight your players.
- Lesson 4: Stuff Yourself
  - Whether it's valuables hoarded by an evil red dragon you've just thwarted, a gift awarded by a grateful dryad, or simply the contents of a treasure chest in an abandoned dungeon room, interesting and exciting items are everywhere in the world of D&D... and this video shows how best to include them.
- Lesson 5: Well, That Was Random.
  - Random encounter tables are a DM's best friend. Learn how to create a list of possible situations and sights that fit your setting that will flavor your party's experience--and keep things always in the hands of fate!
